Your User model should have an active attribute that is false by default
  on login, conditional will check for !active,
   then check the created at date.
   if its older than an amount,
   delete the user,
   else log them in

When the user submits a valid signup form, create a new User (who's active will be false initially)
  change model to default with false

Create a random hash and store it in your database with a reference to the User ID
  create a hash with the email and a email validation secret
  create a uservalidation model that stores a user id and an the hash

Send an email to the supplied email address with the hash as part of a link pointing back to a route on your server
  call to a nodemailer send
  set body to message + a url + the hash linking to the server

When a user clicks the link and hits your route, check for the hash passed in the URL
  create a get route for the validation link sent
  if !hash next(error)

If the hash exists in the database, get the related user and set their active property to true
  query the userValidation collection by hash and get _id
  make an update to user by the _id and set verified to true

Delete the hash from the database, it is no longer needed
