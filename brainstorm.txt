  DONESVILLE

When the user submits a valid signup form, create a new User (who's active will be false initially)
  Xadd expiry to newly created users.

Create a random hash and store it in your database with a reference to the User ID
  Xcreate a hash with the email and a email validation secret
  Xcreate a uservalidation model that stores a user id and an the hash

Send an email to the supplied email address with the hash as part of a link pointing back to a route on your server
  Xcall to a nodemailer send
  Xset body to message + a url + the hash linking to the server

When a user clicks the link and hits your route, check for the hash passed in the URL
  Xcreate a get route for the validation link sent
  Xif !hash next(error)

If the hash exists in the database, get the related user and set their active property to true
  Xquery the userValidation collection by hash and get _id
  Xmake an update to user by the _id and set verified to true

Delete the hash from the database, it is no longer needed
